•	Rigid: Less adaptable to changes once a phase is completed.   

•	Phases: Typically includes requirements, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
•	Focus: Emphasizes thorough documentation and adherence to the original plan.   

•	Best suited for: Projects with well-defined requirements, low risk, and stable environments.   

Agile Methodology
•	Iterative: Involves breaking down the project into smaller cycles or sprints.   

•	Customer-centric: Prioritizes customer satisfaction and feedback.   

•	Flexible: Adapts to changing requirements throughout the project.   

•	Collaborative: Encourages teamwork and cross-functional collaboration.

Prompt engineering is the process of crafting effective prompts to guide AI models in generating desired outputs.
It involves understanding the nuances of natural language processing and the capabilities of the AI model to create prompts that elicit the desired response.   

<p>Importance of Prompt Engineering</p>
<p>Prompt engineering is crucial for several reasons:</p>
•	Improved Output Quality: A well-crafted prompt can significantly enhance the quality and relevance of the AI's response.   
•	Task Specificity: By providing clear instructions, prompts can guide the AI to focus on specific tasks or goals.   
•	Bias Mitigation: Careful prompt design can help reduce biases that might be present in the AI model.   
•	Efficiency: Effective prompts can streamline the interaction with the AI, saving time and effort.
•	Creativity and Innovation: Prompt engineering can be used to explore new creative possibilities and applications of AI.
<p>Example of a Vague and Improved Prompt</p>
Vague Prompt: "Tell me about dogs."
This prompt is too broad and doesn't provide enough direction for the AI to generate a specific response.
Improved Prompt: "Write a 200-word essay discussing the history of dog domestication in Europe."
This prompt is much more specific and provides clear guidelines for the AI. It specifies the desired output (a 200-word essay), the topic (dog domestication), and the location (Europe).
<p>Why the improved prompt is more effective?</p>
•	Clarity: The improved prompt clearly states the desired output and topic.
•	Specificity: It provides specific parameters for the AI to follow, ensuring a focused response.
•	Conciseness: The prompt is direct and to the point, avoiding unnecessary words.
